# UI-Gradients-Counters
## 1. Gradients
### In folder 1. the answer to the following question is found
Consider a ​GradientDrawable (let’s call it gd) displaying a red to blue vertical gradient. Write some code to animate gd so that it smoothly animates from its current state to a green to yellow vertical gradient. In order to animate the gradient you can either use a 2-seconds fixed timing or synchronise it to a ViewPager page scrolling event (using ​positionOffset​ ​from ​onPageScrolled​).
Note: ​you can use API 29 as the min SDK version to simplify your code.

## 2. Spinning counter effect
### In folder 2. The answer to the following question is found 
​Write some code replicating the “counter effect” shown in the video (attached to the email). This counter component displays a settable number. When tapping on it it starts spinning in a slot machine-like manner. The written code should be simple and easy to integrate in a project.

## Notes
It is the answers for completing an assignment. It is written in Kotlin to be fairly short and concise. It requires android studio to run.
